## Terminal

From now on, we will be using the terminal for creating folders and files (it's faster)

Some Useful Commands:

1. `pwd` - Find out the location/name of the folder currently opened in your terminal window.
2. `cd folder-name` - Change directory. Allows you to move in your disk from one location to another.
3. `cd ..` - Move back to the parent folder.
4. `mkdir new-folder` - Create a new folder.

We will also need to download some extensions (these will make your lives a lot easier):

1. Live Server - Ritwick Dey
2. Auto Close Tag - Jun Han
3. Prettier - Code Formatter
4. Auto Rename Tag - Jun Han

In addition to these, you can add a theme and icon pack to your VS code

## Terminal

From now on, we will be using the terminal for creating folders and files (it's faster)

Some Useful Commands:

`pwd` - Find out the location/name of the folder currently opened in your terminal window.
`cd folder-name` - Change directory. Allows you to move in your disk from one location to another.
`cd ..` - Move back to the parent folder.
`mkdir new-folder` - Create a new folder.

## Git

## Node & Npm

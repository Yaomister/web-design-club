# BASIC HTML

##HTML Documents

All HTMl Documents start with a document type declaration --> `<!DOCTYPE html>`

To indicate where your HTML code starts (your "block" of code) start with a `<html>` and end with `</html>`

The visible part of the HTML document is between  `<body>` and `</body>`

A shortcut is to type "!" and press enter

##HTML Elements

These are headings, with `<h1>` being the largest and `<h6>` being the least:

```
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is heading 1</h4>
<h5>This is heading 2</h5>
<h6>This is heading 3</h6>
```

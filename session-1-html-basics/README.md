## BASIC HTML

** HTML Documents **


All HTMl Documents start with a document type declaration --> `<!DOCTYPE html>`

To indicate where your HTML code starts (your "block" of code) start with a `<html>` and end with `</html>`

The visible part of the HTML document is between  `<body>` and `</body>`

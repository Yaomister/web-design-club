            <p > Giorno Giovanna (ジョルノ・ジョバァーナ Joruno Jobāna) is the protagonist of Part 5 and the fifth JoJo of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Giorno is the illegitimate son of DIO, conceived with Jonathan Joestar's stolen body. He is introduced as Haruno Shiobana (汐華 初流乃). He speaks of his intention to join the powerful gang Passione and his dream of becoming a "Gang-Star". He is also featured in the light novel JORGE JOESTAR as an ally.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Giorno is a natural-born Stand User wielding the life-giving Gold Experience in battle.</p>

            <p> Giorno is a teenage boy of average height and slim yet muscular build, far smaller in stature than previous JoJos. He has golden hair of moderate length tied back in a short, braided tail, with three distinctive oversized curls arranged in a row over his forehead. His hair was originally black and unkempt but transformed upon awakening his Stand.[3] His eyes, especially present in earlier depictions, sharpen at the ends similar to those of his father's. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Giorno wears a two-piece suit with a checkered coat tail and several ornate features, including wing-shaped emblems on the collars and a heart-shaped opening in the chest area. The most distinctive feature on his suit are the three ladybug emblems located on either side of his chest and directly below his zipper, matching the appearance of his Stand. Later on, his shoes also have the same ladybug emblem on them. The color scheme for his suit often changes in different depictions, but the most common colors are blue outlined with gold and pink outlined with green.</p>

            <p>Giorno's childhood was filled with unhappiness and loneliness due to bullies and the abuse by his stepfather. During his early childhood, he was initially cold and uncaring towards anyone and believed himself to be scum just for the way people treated him. Those that knew him easily thought he'd grow up to become a twisted individual. This changed when he befriended an injured gangster he saved. As the man protected Giorno from those that did him wrong in return for his aid, he learned that he could trust people. Since then, he has become a more confident and solicitous person.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A defining characteristic of Giorno, and shared among his peers through him, is his resolve (覚悟 kakugo); something that can be described as his ability to make important decisions without hesitation and seeing them through to the very end, even in the face of pain, sorrow, and tragedy. Throughout Part 5, Giorno's resolve is such that in the heat of battle, he is frequently willing to allow himself to be injured if it leads to an advantageous situation. An ambitious individual, he readily takes any occasion to achieve his final goal of becoming a "Gang-Star". Upon beginning to cooperate with Passione gangster Bruno Bucciarati, Giorno wastes no time in infiltrating the gang, and steadily works his way up the ranks. His assassination of Polpo was partially a way to get a promotion for Bucciarati. Later, Giorno also tried to personally approach the Boss of Passione, and planned to plant a tracking device on him.</p>

            <p>Gold Experience is one of the most versatile Stands in the series. It has the ability to create and manipulate life, which Giorno most often uses to produce plants and small animals. Both can be used for a variety of purposes ranging from disguise to tracking origins. As a short-ranged Power-type, it is also capable of unleashing a rapid barrage of punches, which Giorno uses almost exclusively with lethal intent.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Gold Experience Requiem is obtained after Giorno pierces Gold Experience with the Stand-creating Arrow. It has the ability to prevent his opponents from "reaching the truth.” Whoever is killed by Requiem will also "never arrive at the truth behind their death" forcing them into a death loop for all eternity. Its ability transcends other Stand abilities, hinting at the thought that Requiem Stands are in a league all their own in comparison to more pedestrian Stands.</p>
